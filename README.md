# CowPuzzle

Over the holidays, my mom put out a "Scramble Squares" style puzzle with pictures of cows on it. After many attempts to solve, and zero solutions, I decided it would be more fun to tell a computer to solve it. I then decided this might be an interesting case study to experiment with F#, and ported my solution to that.
